## Overview

The **Character Voting App** is an interactive web application that allows users to vote for their favorite characters, view character details, and add new characters to the list. This app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and integrates with a **JSON server** to manage the character data, such as names, images, and votes.

Key features include:
- Displaying a list of characters.
- Viewing detailed information for each character.
- Voting for characters and updating their vote count in real-time.
- Resetting votes for all characters.
- Adding new characters via a form.

## Features

   - The vote count is updated in real-time, both on the server and in the UI.

### 3. **Reset Votes**
